          The 2011 American Community Survey (ACS) estimated the Seattle median household income to be about $61,000. This was well above the national median household income. However, this was somewhat lower than the median household income for the Seattle metro area, reflecting the high concentrations of one-person households, students, and young adults who live in Seattle. The ACS estimated the Seattle median family income to be roughly $91,000, which is markedly higher than median family income in the broader Seattle metro area.
